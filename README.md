==============

For user and developer-contributed examples, tools, documentation, etc.

The idea is that contributing code to this repository will be much simpler than contributing to the main brian2 repository, without any code review, etc.

In the future, we will automatically generate a webpage from this repository, which will be an additional source of information to the main docs.
